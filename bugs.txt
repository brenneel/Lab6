Potential issues:

1: dequeue() has a type of void, but in the docs it says it should return
    the value of the entry at the front of the queue
    --This could be an intentional change on Gibbons' part, but wanted to note it

Bugs:
1) Enqueue adds elements to the front of the queue, not the back
2) Enqueue is causing memory leaks, there is a "new" that is not being deleted
